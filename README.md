# migrate_iobroker_mysql_to_influxdb
Python script to migrate ioBroker MySQL (SQL History Adapter) data to influxDB (Logging data with influxDB)

Based on a script from UlliJ from the [ioBroker Forum](https://forum.iobroker.net/topic/12482/frage-migrate-mysql-nach-influxdb/26)

I have used the script to migrate 22 million records from a MySQL DB running on a Rasperry Pi to an influxDB on a Synology.
